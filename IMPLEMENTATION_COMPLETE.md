# EMHASS EV Charging Extension - Implementation Complete! üéâ

## Summary

**YES, all steps have been completed to implement EV loads in EMHASS!** The EV charging extension is now fully implemented in your forked EMHASS repository.

## ‚úÖ What We Accomplished

### 1. **Configuration Extension** (COMPLETED ‚úì)

- **File**: `src/emhass/data/config_defaults.json`
- **Added**: 5 new EV configuration parameters:
  - `number_of_ev_loads`: Number of EVs to optimize (0 = disabled)
  - `ev_battery_capacity`: Battery capacity in Wh for each EV
  - `ev_charging_efficiency`: Charging efficiency (0-1) for each EV
  - `ev_nominal_charging_power`: Maximum charging power in W for each EV
  - `ev_minimum_charging_power`: Minimum charging power in W for each EV

### 2. **Runtime Parameter Handling** (COMPLETED ‚úì)

- **File**: `src/emhass/data/associations.csv`
- **Added**: 3 new runtime parameters:
  - `ev_availability`: 2D array for EV connection status (0/1 for each time step)
  - `ev_minimum_soc_schedule`: 2D array for minimum SOC requirements
  - `ev_initial_soc`: Array of initial SOC values for each EV

### 3. **Core Optimization Engine** (COMPLETED ‚úì)

- **File**: `src/emhass/optimization.py`
- **Added EV Variables**:
  - `P_ev[ev_idx][i]`: EV charging power variables
  - `SOC_ev[ev_idx][i]`: EV state of charge variables
  - `P_ev_bin[ev_idx][i]`: EV binary availability variables

### 4. **EV Constraints Implementation** (COMPLETED ‚úì)

- **Availability Constraints**: EV can only charge when connected
- **Minimum Power Constraints**: When charging, must be above minimum power
- **SOC Dynamics**: Proper SOC tracking with charging efficiency
- **Minimum SOC Requirements**: Ensure SOC meets schedule requirements

### 5. **Power Balance Integration** (COMPLETED ‚úì)

- **Modified**: `P_def_sum` calculation to include EV power
- **Result**: EV charging is now part of the main optimization objective

### 6. **Results Extraction** (COMPLETED ‚úì)

- **Added**: EV power and SOC results to optimization output
- **Format**: `P_EV0`, `P_EV1`, `SOC_EV0`, `SOC_EV1`, etc.

## üîß Technical Details

### EV Variables Created:

```python
# For each EV (ev_idx):
P_ev[ev_idx][i]      # Charging power at time i (0 to nominal_power)
SOC_ev[ev_idx][i]    # State of charge at time i (0 to 1)
P_ev_bin[ev_idx][i]  # Binary variable for availability
```

### Key Constraints Added:

```python
# 1. Availability: Can only charge when connected
P_ev <= availability[i] * nominal_power * P_ev_bin

# 2. Minimum power: When charging, must be above minimum
P_ev >= minimum_power * P_ev_bin

# 3. SOC dynamics: Track battery charge level
SOC[i] = SOC[i-1] + (P_ev[i] * efficiency * timestep) / battery_capacity

# 4. Minimum SOC: Meet schedule requirements
SOC[i] >= minimum_soc_schedule[i]
```

### Power Balance Integration:

```python
# Old: P_def_sum = sum(deferrable_loads)
# New: P_def_sum = sum(deferrable_loads) + sum(ev_loads)
P_def_sum = deferrable_sum + ev_sum
```

## üöÄ How to Use

### 1. **Configure Your EVs** in Home Assistant Add-on:

```yaml
number_of_ev_loads: 2
ev_battery_capacity: [60000, 75000] # 60kWh, 75kWh
ev_charging_efficiency: [0.9, 0.85] # 90%, 85%
ev_nominal_charging_power: [7400, 11000] # 7.4kW, 11kW
ev_minimum_charging_power: [1380, 2000] # 1.38kW, 2kW
```

### 2. **Pass Runtime Parameters** via API:

```python
{
  "ev_availability": [
    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1],  # EV1: 6PM-8AM
    [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]   # EV2: All day except work
  ],
  "ev_minimum_soc_schedule": [
    [0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.8,0.8,0.8,...],      # EV1: Need 80% by 7AM
    [0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,...]       # EV2: Maintain 40%
  ],
  "ev_initial_soc": [0.15, 0.30]                         # Starting charge levels
}
```

### 3. **Get Optimization Results**:

```python
# Results include:
results['P_EV0']    # EV1 charging schedule
results['P_EV1']    # EV2 charging schedule
results['SOC_EV0']  # EV1 SOC profile
results['SOC_EV1']  # EV2 SOC profile
```
