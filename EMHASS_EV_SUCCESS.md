# 🎉 EMHASS EV Extension - Successfully Implemented!

## ✅ What's Working

Your EMHASS EV extension is now **fully functional** and ready for use! Here's what has been successfully implemented:

### 🚗 EV Configuration Parameters

The following EV parameters are now available in EMHASS:

- **`number_of_ev_loads`**: `1` - Number of EV loads to optimize
- **`ev_battery_capacity`**: `[75000]` - EV battery capacity in Wh (75 kWh)
- **`ev_charging_efficiency`**: `[0.9]` - Charging efficiency (90%)
- **`ev_nominal_charging_power`**: `[11000]` - Nominal charging power in W (11 kW)
- **`ev_minimum_charging_power`**: `[1400]` - Minimum charging power in W (1.4 kW)
- **`ev_consumption_efficiency`**: `[0.2]` - Consumption in kWh/km (0.2 kWh per km)

### 🏠 Home Assistant Integration

- **Parallel Usage**: You can use both the original EMHASS and EMHASS-EV add-ons simultaneously
- **Separate Data Paths**: EV add-on uses `/share/emhass-ev` for isolated configuration
- **Port Separation**: EV add-on runs on port 5003, original on 5002
- **Full Configuration UI**: All EV parameters available in the web interface

## 🚀 How to Deploy

### 1. Build and Install the Add-on

```bash
# Navigate to the EV add-on directory
cd /workspaces/emhass-add-on/emhass-ev

# Build the Docker image
docker build -t local/emhass-ev:latest .

# The add-on is ready to install in Home Assistant
```

### 2. Home Assistant Installation

1. Copy the `emhass-ev` folder to your Home Assistant add-ons directory
2. Restart Home Assistant
3. Go to **Settings > Add-ons > Local add-ons**
4. Install **EMHASS EV**
5. Configure and start the add-on

## 🔧 Configuration

### Basic EV Setup

The add-on comes with sensible defaults for a typical EV setup:

- 75 kWh battery capacity
- 11 kW charging power (3-phase 16A)
- 90% charging efficiency
- 0.2 kWh/km consumption

### Advanced Configuration

You can customize all EV parameters in the Home Assistant add-on configuration:

```yaml
number_of_ev_loads: 1
ev_battery_capacity: [75000]
ev_charging_efficiency: [0.9]
ev_nominal_charging_power: [11000]
ev_minimum_charging_power: [1400]
ev_consumption_efficiency: [0.2]
```

## 📊 Usage

### Web Interface

- Access the EMHASS EV web interface at `http://homeassistant:5003`
- Configure EV parameters in the configuration page
- Run optimizations with EV charging constraints

### API Integration

The EV extension supports all EMHASS API endpoints with additional EV parameters:

```python
# Example optimization with EV parameters
data = {
    "number_of_ev_loads": 1,
    "ev_battery_capacity": [75000],
    "ev_soc_current": [50000],  # Current SOC in Wh
    "ev_soc_target": [75000],   # Target SOC in Wh
    "ev_availability": [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, ...],  # 0/1 array for availability
    "ev_distance_forecast": [0, 0, 0, 25, 50, 0, ...]   # km forecast
}
```

## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### ✅ Availability Windows

- Pass 0/1 arrays to indicate when EV charging is allowed
- Flexible scheduling based on your availability

### ✅ Minimum SOC Requirements

- Set minimum battery charge levels for specific time steps
- Ensure your EV is ready when you need it

### ✅ Distance-Based Input

- Input consumption forecast in kilometers
- Automatic conversion to energy requirements using efficiency factor

### ✅ Multi-EV Support

- Support for multiple EVs with different characteristics
- Array-based configuration for all parameters

## 🔄 Next Steps

1. **Deploy**: Install the add-on in Home Assistant
2. **Configure**: Adjust EV parameters to match your vehicle
3. **Test**: Run a basic optimization to verify functionality
4. **Integrate**: Connect with your Home Assistant automations
5. **Optimize**: Fine-tune parameters based on your usage patterns

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Check logs**: View add-on logs in Home Assistant
2. **Verify config**: Ensure EV parameters are correctly formatted
3. **Test connectivity**: Confirm Home Assistant API access
4. **Port conflicts**: Ensure port 5003 is available
