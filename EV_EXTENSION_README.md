# EMHASS EV Charging Extension

This repository contains a comprehensive extension to EMHASS (Energy Management for Home Assistant) that adds advanced EV (Electric Vehicle) charging optimization capabilities.

## üöó What This Extension Adds

The EV extension allows you to optimize your electric vehicle charging with:

- **Time-based availability control**: Define when your EV is connected using binary arrays (0/1)
- **Dynamic SOC requirements**: Set minimum battery charge levels for different times
- **Multi-EV support**: Optimize multiple electric vehicles simultaneously
- **Intelligent scheduling**: Balance EV charging with existing deferrable loads and home energy needs

### Examples

- `example_ev_optimization.py` - Working Python examples demonstrating API usage

## üîß How It Works

### 1. Configure Your EVs

Add EV parameters to your Home Assistant add-on configuration:

```yaml
number_of_ev_loads: 1
ev_battery_capacity: [60000] # 60kWh battery
ev_charging_efficiency: [0.9] # 90% charging efficiency
ev_nominal_charging_power: [7400] # 7.4kW charger
ev_minimum_charging_power: [1380] # 1.38kW minimum power
```

### 2. Define Availability & SOC Requirements

Pass dynamic schedules when calling the optimization:

```python
# EV connected 6PM-8AM (typical commuter pattern)
ev_availability = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]]

# Need 80% charge by 7AM for commute
ev_minimum_soc_schedule = [[0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8]]

# Starting with 20% battery
ev_initial_soc = [0.2]
```

### 3. Optimize Your Charging

The extension integrates with EMHASS's linear programming optimization to:

- Schedule EV charging during optimal times (low cost, high solar production)
- Ensure minimum SOC requirements are met
- Balance multiple EVs with household energy needs
- Respect grid constraints and power limits

## üìä Example Scenarios

### Daily Commuter

```python
# Connected: 6PM-8AM, need 80% by 7AM
ev_availability = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]]
min_soc_schedule = [[0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.8,0.8,...]]
```

### Weekend Trip Planning

```python
# Connected Friday-Sunday, need 90% by Saturday 8AM
ev_availability = [[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]]
min_soc_schedule = [[0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.9,0.9,...]]
```

### Multi-EV Household

```python
# Two EVs with different patterns and requirements
ev_availability = [
    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1],  # EV1: evening
    [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]   # EV2: all day except work
]
```
